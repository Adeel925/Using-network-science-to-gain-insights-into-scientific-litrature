# Using-network-science-to-gain-insights-into-scientific-litrature

This my research thesiss where i used network science principles and machine learning principles to cluster scientific litrature related to covid 19. 

The work includes: 

## Data processing 
1) Data collection related to covid_19 articles
2) Data cleaning and ornization
3) All kind of cleaning tasks related to text data

## Network representations
4) Converting the cleaned data into graph to use network science principles
5) Then created network of articles using there common words between each other with the weighted network
6) Then used community detection algorithms with weights to find out correlated groups

## Machine learning 
7) Created the vector representations of each articles textual corpus using TF/IDF vectorizer
8) Passed those vectors into k-means to group correlated articles

## Evalautions
#### 9) Qualtitive evaluation using data visualiszations
   - Top rpeated words bar charts.
   - wordclouds
   - comparison of top words in different communities

#### 10) Quantitative evaluation different metrics
- Cosine similarity inter communities
- Cosine similarity of documents intra communities
